# The shopping cart is created in JavaScript

The shopping cart is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Order data is stored in the local storage and an email is sent once the purchase is made with the email.js library. You can find further details regarding the project in the following [link](https://carrocompras.netlify.app/).

Please note that the original project is all in Spanish of the south American variety. I am working on converting this to English.
